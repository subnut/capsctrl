What it does
------------
It listens for key presses...

- If the CapsLock key is merely tapped, it behaves as a normal CapsLock key.

- If the CapsLock key has been held down for a duration more than a
  configurable delay, it makes the CapsLock key behave as a Control key.

- If the CapsLock key has been held pressed-down while pressing another key, it
  makes the CapsLock key behave as a Control key.


What is it useful for
--------------------
It is useful for mapping the CapsLock key to the Control key without losing
it's original functionality.  This _may_ help avoid RSI.


What if I want to change its behaviour (like changing the delay, etc.)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Since it is written in simple C, and the source code is very small (~200 SLOC),
I encourage you to try and see if you can implement it yourself.

If, for *any* reason, you aren't able to implement what you wanted, I am happy
to help!  :)
